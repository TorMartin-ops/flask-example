# --- Example Database Tests (Adapt these to your specific functions) ---

# This section needs to be implemented based on your actual database functions.
# You'll need to import the specific functions you want to test from database.py
# and write tests that use the 'db' fixture.

# Example Test Structure (You need to import and use your functions):
# def test_example_database_function(db):
#     """Example test for a database function."""
#     # Use the 'db' connection to set up test data if needed
#     # Call the database function you are testing
#     # Use assert statements to check the results
#     pass # Replace with actual test logic

# Since I don't have the full context of your database functions readily available here,
# I cannot write specific tests for them automatically. You will need to write these tests.
# Remember to import the functions you are testing from database.py
# e.g., from database import add_user, verify

# Once imported, you can write tests like:
# def test_add_and_verify_user(db):
#     # Your test logic here using add_user, verify, and the 'db' fixture
#     pass
